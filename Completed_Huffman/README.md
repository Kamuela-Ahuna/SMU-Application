# SMU Application: Huffman Compressor

## Preface

The contents of this folder are to be considered Kamuela Ahuna's application
material for SMU Guildhall. Inside this folder, there are three items you should
familiarize yourself with. I will walk you through the contents of the folders below.

Note: All code for this project is in C++ through Visual Studios. If you have
any issues with the project, please do not hesitate to contact me at the following

## Item One

The first item to be aware of is the folder entitled "Completed_Huffman_Compressor".
This folder contains necessary files for the program to run, namely the "input.txt" file.
Before you run the program, locate the "input.txt" file in the folder named above.
If you cannot find the file, simply create one. Once you have opened the file,
you may fill it with whatever text you want. This program has been tested with
up to 26kb of data inside the text document.

Upon running the program, two new files will be added into this folder.
The first file, "huffman.dat", holds the binary information for the compressed data.
This is the file to review when you wish to view the difference between the
original data and the compressed form.

The second file is the "output.txt" document. This file is where the decompressed
string will be placed. If the program runs correctly, the output.txt file and the
input.txt file should match.

## Item two

The second item to take note of is the Completed_Huffman_Compressor.sln file.
This is the Visual Studio file you should use when running the program. It contains
the code that I have written to complete this assignment. I have been having issues
uploading this folder recently, so I have included an additional item that will
contain the code I have written in the event that this item is not usable upon review.

## Item three

The final item to familiarize yourself with is the "Backup_Code.md" file. This
file simply contains a copy of the code used to complete this assignment. Should
something go wrong when trying to use Item Two, copy the contents of this file
and paste it into a new C++ project. Once you have done this, ensure you have
created the "input.txt" file within the directory and the program should run.

### Final Remarks

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. Should you have any questions,
please contact me at the information listed above.
