# SMU-Application

This repository is to store the items I wish to include in my SMU Guildhall Application.

## Completed_Huffman

This folder contains the Huffman Compressor assignment listed at [this](https://www.smu.edu/-/media/Site/guildhallOLD/Documents/Huffman_Exercise.pdf?la=en) url.

This project was started on October 27th, 2019, and took a rough total of two weeks to complete.
