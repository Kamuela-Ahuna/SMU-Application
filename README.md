# SMU-Application

This repository is to store the items I wish to include in my SMU Guildhall Application.

## Completed_Huffman

This folder contains the Huffman Compressor assignment listed at [this](https://www.smu.edu/-/media/Site/guildhallOLD/Documents/Huffman_Exercise.pdf?la=en) url.
Additionally, there is a README.md inside to walk you through the project.

This project was started on October 27th, 2019, and took a rough total of two weeks to complete.

## Resouce_Manager

This folder contains "Assignment 1" from [this](https://www.smu.edu/Guildhall/Admissions/Portfolio-Requirements/Programming) webpage.
Like the previous project, there is a README.md inside to show you how everything works.

This project was started on September 22nd, 2019, and was finished on September 28th, 2019.

## Last Opportunity

This folder contains the game build for Last Opportunity, a game we created for a
game jam at the Computer Simulation and Gaming Conference in Tulsa. The theme was
"Space" and there were a number of restrictions placed on the teams that competed.
The game had to be a survival game where the player faced waves of enemies that
got stronger with each passing wave. There must also be an alien somewhere in the game.

The controls are listed below:

| --- | --- |
| Move | Arrow keys or WASD Keys|
|Boost | Space (Deals damage and makes the player invulnerable) |
| Aim | Mouse Movement |
| Fire | Left Click |

I was the lead programmer on the project and there were three other members on the team.

For an additional level to play, click the first "O" in Opportunity on the title screen.
The record for Waves Survived on this level is 3.
